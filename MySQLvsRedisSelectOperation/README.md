Recommended way to run:
python pbac_mysql_data_generator.py -h
Look at this help and run python accordingly. It is recommended not to use "-j" option.
After running the above python script, a mysql script file is generated as output (default name "dummy.sql", but can be customized by -o option). 
Now, run the mysql script file into a mysql database of your choice. 

After running the mysql script, in application.properties do the following:
1. Put the value of "-n" option used while running python script in "database.columns.integer" property.
2. Put the value of "-s" option used while running python script in "database.columns.string" property.
3. Put the value of "-v" option used while running python script in "database.columns.values" property.
4. Write your "hql.result.query" and "hql.selectall.query" according to how you require. (This can be taken care of by the "-j" option of the python script "pbac_mysql_data_generator.py", but this is not recommended).
5. Put in the number of random queries per test case that you need to generate in "num.select.queries".
6. Put in the number of test cases you need in "num.test.cases".


IMPORTANT: Rewrite the class "com.ezdi.poc.beans.Dummy" according to the columns of the new table "dummy" formed by executing the mysql script file (default name dummy.sql) generated by the python script "pbac_mysql_data_generator.py".
